# games
games made using the all powerful pygame :)

Spacerace is literally the only game that is working since the rest of them are incomplete projects :(

I used these games to get started with my python learning since I found that they are a fun and interesting way to learn python. We all know that pygame is the superior game engine so all the games are in python :). (Also because I didn't know anything about C++ or C# at the time)
